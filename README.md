# Chicago Crime Data_Core Project 4

For this assignment, we will be starting an additional portfolio project that we will continue to build on over the remaining weeks of this stack.

For Part 1, we will be downloading and preparing a crime dataset for time series analysis.
we will then answer provided stakeholder questions and support our answers with visualizations.


## Chicago Crime Data
- Source: Chicago Data Portal: Crimes 2001 to Present
  - Data Description:
    - All Crimes that were reported in the city of Chicago and their details

## Task
Our task is to answer a series of questions about trends in crimes in Chicago for a reporter for the local newspaper.

- Stakeholder Questions to Answer (pick at least 3 topics) Select 3 or more of the following topics to analyze:
1). Comparing Police Districts:
  - Which district has the most crimes? Which has the least?
  
2). Crimes Across the Years:
  - Is the total number of crimes increasing or decreasing across the years?
  - Are there any individual crimes that are doing the opposite (e.g decreasing when overall crime is increasing or vice-versa)?
  
3). Comparing AM vs. PM Rush Hour:
  - Are crimes more common during AM rush hour or PM rush hour?
    - You can consider any crime that occurred between 7 AM - 10 AM as AM rush hour
    - You can consider any crime that occurred between 4 -7 PM as PM rush hour.
  - What are the top 5 most common crimes during AM rush hour? What are the top 5 most common crimes during PM rush hour?
  - Are Motor Vehicle Thefts more common during AM rush hour or PM Rush Hour?
  
4). Comparing Months:
 - What months have the most crime? What months have the least?
 - Are there any individual crimes that do not follow this pattern? If so, which crimes?

5). Comparing Holidays:
  - Are there any holidays that show an increase in the # of crimes?
  - Are there any holidays that show a decrease in the # of crimes?
